Particle Fountain
=============

Originally I had to write this program to pass a lecture during my computer sciences studies. So this program is mainly for 
educational purposes and neither shows good programming style nor is the best way to get things done, it just works
for me. Nevertheless it can be useful because there aren't many information on the topic in the web.


Installation
------------

 - install svgalib (called libvga on debian)
 - install nasm (the Netwide Assembler)
 a)
   - type "nasm -f elf asm_effect.s"
   - type "gcc asm_effect.o -lvga -o asm_effect"
 b)
  - run "make" inside the project root folder


Running
-------

 * type "sudo ./particle_fountain"
